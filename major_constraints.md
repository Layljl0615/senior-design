# Major Constraints
### We identified several topical areas that may constrain the possible solutions for our project.

Economic Cost
- AWS costs money and we will need it to train the ML model  

Time
- Not really constricted by time
- Training the ML model will probably take the longest amount of time  

Scope
- We all agree on scope and understand the deadlines and components connected with the scope of the project  

Professional/Technical Expertise
- Our team lacks in ML expertise, so it might take up longer to solve problems and debug if issues arise  

Ethical/ Legal
- Our product directly impacts vision-impaired users and we will do product testing to ensure it is a positive experience
- Might look into the legality behind disability assistive technology
- Follow global internet guidelines such as GDPR and CCPA  

Security
- Our product could send potentially private information to our backend systems
- User’s private information should not be used in our learning model  

Social
- Our project is based around creating a better screen reader that will directly benefit vision-impaired users
- Our hope is to enhance the user’s experience navigating the internet  

Environmental
- Our product will require an internet browser
- There will be no environmental impact  

Diversity and Cultural Impact
- Our product will most likely only be available in English
- Promoting diverse internet usage by allowing vision-impaired users to navigate the internet and give them experiences similar to able-bodied users
